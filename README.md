# Udacity_Make-effective-Data-Visualizations


## Summary
Work consists of many activites: Writing papers, talking to colleagues, having meetings, and much more. Some activites, like talking to colleagues, are important for social purposes but are not productive per se. Since the end of 2013 I documented my own *productive work*. This visualization displays the amount of productive work I have done *on a weekly basis* since then.

## Design
As I was interested in depicting a **comparison** I chose a [barchart](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2013/04/chart-chooser). My data is *continuous* and *categorial*. The amount of work per week is *continuous* and the weeks are *categorial*. Having only two variables, a two-dimensional visualization was appropriate. A barchart allowed me to combine the two variable types. The x-axis can be used for the continuous and the y-axis for the categorial variable.

I started with a simple barcart. The barchart depicted the amount of work on a weekly basis. I did not have any interactive elements at the beginning. It troubled me that the x-axis was heavily overloaded due to the amount of weeks since 2013. The labels on the x-axis could not be read because it was too dense. I decided to remove the labels from the x-axis and use a mouse-over effect instead. When a user hovers over a bar the week and the hours of work should be displayed in another window. I did not really know where to place this window. In the end I decided to put it in the lower left corner of the barchart. This position safed some valuable space and allowed a close proximity to the selected bar.

During the design process I wanted a feature that allows users to see the distribution for specific weeks. 

One user thought that the bars were clickable, although I did not use a hand cursor on the bars. I decided not to incorporate
